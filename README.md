A small playground showcasing Swift's Extension and Custom Operator features, based on [a blog post of mine](http://publicstaticvoidbrain.tumblr.com/post/119551147489/extensions-and-operators-in-swift) on how cool Swift is as a language

#### How to play around

If you don't have XCode and the command line tools, grab them [here](https://developer.apple.com/xcode/download/). Then simply open the playground file in XCode (either from the Finder or in XCode itself).
